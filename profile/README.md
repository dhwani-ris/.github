## 💡 Why We Contribute to Open Source

At Dhwani RIS, we believe that **technology should democratize access to solutions**, especially in the social sector. Our contributions to the Frappe ecosystem stem from our core philosophy:

- **Giving Back**: The open-source community has enabled our growth, and we want to give back
- **Collaborative Innovation**: Better solutions emerge when we work together
- **Accessibility**: Making powerful tools available to organizations with limited resources
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Empowering other developers and organizations to build impactful solutions

**We love to contribute** because every line of code we share can potentially amplify social impact across the globe. When a small NGO in rural India can use our theming solution to create a better user experience, or when an international foundation can leverage our SMS integration for better communication with beneficiaries, we know our contributions are making a difference.
